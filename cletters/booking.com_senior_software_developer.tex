\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm a backend engineer with \textbf{5+ years} of experience in hands on software development ranging from building REST Services to distributed systems that scales. At Present I'm a Tech Lead in the team but in the past I've also played the role of (Dev)Ops managing a large infrastructure on AWS. I also have experience managing moderately sized installations of Hadoop/Spark/Mesos clusters and fine tuning them for maximum performance. Apart from using and managing a wide variety of open source tools I also \href{https://github.com/ashwanthkumar}{contribute back to the community} as and when possible.

I have been building things for JVM using Java and \href{https://git.io/vQgx5}{Scala} for the most part. I also have experience building some \href{https://github.com/ashwanthkumar/gotlb}{infrastruce services} in Golang too.

\lettersection{Why Booking.com?}
At 1,000,000 (and counting) properties, the scale of doing things is going to be massive. I'm currently looking forward to those kind of challenges in my carrer at this point to put all my skills to test. I also found a strong connect on the culture at Booking.com to that I have been used to. I should just fit right in from day one.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Apart from the technical skills that I have acquired and some more that I will have to pick up at Booking.com once I join, I come with a strong cultural background of working in a startup. Being one of the early employees in an startup and growing along with it teaches you a lot of valuable lessons. I've mentored young engineers over the last few years for them to be successful at their roles. I have also built some technology within the organisation that helped in cost reduction, automation and so on. I have also represented my current employer in various \href{https://speakerdeck.com/ashwanthkumar/}{meetups, conferences} and \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyMKpkdEV2csQg93bEPv2R27sawxIm9zG}{talks} around the city.
