\begin{cvletter}

I'm Ashwanth Kumar, a backend engineer with \textbf{5+ years} of experience from Chennai, India. My experience includes hands on software development ranging from building REST Services to distributed systems that scales. At Present, I'm a Tech Lead in our crawling team but in the past I've also played the role of (Dev)Ops managing a large infrastructure on AWS. I also have experience setting up and managing moderately sized installations of Hadoop/Spark/Mesos clusters and fine tuning them for maximum performance. Apart from using and managing a wide variety of open source tools I also \href{https://github.com/ashwanthkumar}{contribute back to the community} as and when possible.

I have been building things for JVM using Java and \href{https://git.io/vQgx5}{Scala} for the most part. I also have experience building some \href{https://github.com/ashwanthkumar/gotlb}{infrastruce services} in Golang too.

Apart from the technical skills that I have acquired and some more that I will have to pick up at InnoGames once I join, I come with a strong cultural background of working in a startup. Being one of the early employees in an startup and growing along with it teaches you a lot of valuable lessons. I've mentored young engineers over the last few years for them to be successful at their roles. I have also built some technology within the organisation that helped in cost reduction, automation and so on. I have also represented my current employer in various \href{https://speakerdeck.com/ashwanthkumar/}{meetups, conferences} and \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyMKpkdEV2csQg93bEPv2R27sawxIm9zG}{talks} around the city.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
\begin{cvparagraph}
I read the job description at \href{https://www.innogames.com/career/open-positions/detail/job/senior-scala-developer-backend-warlords/}{InnoGames website} and felt I qualify for most of the requirements.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
  \item {Have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.}
  \item {Been writing code in Scala for 4+ years now. It has always been my go to language from work to hackathons.}
  \item {I have not built services for mobile applications nor do I have experience in C#. But that's only a matter of opportunity that I have got so far. I believe in using the right tool for the job.}
  \item {Built REST services which are mostly part of our micro services architecture.}
  \item {Believer of TDD and strong believer of open source culture within the organization. Any changes would be sent as a Pull Request which would be reviewed and merged by the respective teams.}
\end{cvitems}
